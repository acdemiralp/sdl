## SDL
Header-only C++20 wrapper for SDL 2.28.4+.

### Building the tests
- Run `bootstrap.[bat|sh]`. This will install doctest + sdl, and create the project under the `./build` directory.
- Run cmake on the `./build` directory and toggle `BUILD_TESTS`.
- Configure, generate, make.

### Using
The cmake project exports the `sdl::sdl` target, hence you can:
```cmake
find_package         (sdl CONFIG REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries([YOUR_PROJECT_NAME] PRIVATE sdl::sdl)
```
And then point the `sdl_DIR` to the build or installation directory.
Alternatively, you can copy the contents of the include folder to your project.

### Usage notes
- Define `SDL_USE_EXCEPTIONS` to check the return values of all viable functions and throw an exception on failure.

### Design notes
- Constructors:
  - Copy constructors are deleted unless SDL provides copy functions for the object.
  - Move constructors are available whenever possible.
  - The object wrappers have the capability to both:
    - Construct a  new      SDL object, and be           responsible for its destruction.
    - Accept    an existing SDL object, and be or not be responsible for its destruction.
- Structures:
  - Structs are for POD data types. They may only contain member variables, constructors, destructors and assignment operators.
- Statics:
  - Namespace functions are preferred over static member functions whenever possible.
- Error Handling:
  - Error handling is performed only if the documentation of the native function specifies an error state.
- Versioning:
  - The major, minor and patch version are identical to the supported version of SDL.
- Other:
  - The order of parameters are identical to the SDL with the following exceptions: 
    - Parameters with default values are moved to the end of the function.
    - Parameters with default values are ordered from the most to least likely to be changed.
- Design TODOs:
  - Evaluate each instance of `#ifdef SDL_USE_EXCEPTIONS` and deem if the error is terminal i.e. should throw an exception, or not.

### Coverage 
- The coverage is derived from the [SDL2 include directory](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include) and categorized according to the [SDL 2.0 API by Category](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/APIByCategory) documentation.
